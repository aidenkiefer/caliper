## Notes
- **Planning Phase:** Antigravity Agents (current)
- **Implementation Phase:** Cursor Agents (handoff after planning complete)
- **Risk Level:** 6-7 (moderate) - controlled drawdowns, systematic risk management
- **First Deployment:** Paper trading only, then live with strict safeguards
